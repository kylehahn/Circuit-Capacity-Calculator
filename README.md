# sensor3d

Native Qt 6 + C++20 desktop editor for layered sensor PCB topology with BEM
capacitance computation. The browser prototype lives at
[`../sensor3d_editor.html`](../sensor3d_editor.html) and remains the
behavioural reference during the port.

## Quick start (any platform)

```
git clone <repo-url> sensor3d
cd sensor3d
# 1. Bootstrap vcpkg (one-time per machine, idempotent):
tools/bootstrap.sh         # macOS / Linux
tools\bootstrap.ps1        # Windows (PowerShell)

# 2. Configure + build:
cmake --preset linux-release        # macos-release / windows-release
cmake --build --preset linux-release -j
ctest --preset linux-release

# 3. Run:
./build/linux-release/sensor3d
```

> First configure compiles Qt from source via vcpkg — **30–60 minutes**. Every
> subsequent configure on the same machine is seconds, and CI/cache covers
> other machines.

## Prerequisites

| Platform | Compiler | Other |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Windows  | Visual Studio 2022 (MSVC + CMake + Windows SDK) | Git, PowerShell 7 |
| macOS    | Xcode 15+ command-line tools                    | Homebrew, `brew install cmake ninja pkg-config` |
| Linux    | GCC 12+ or Clang 15+                            | `sudo apt install build-essential cmake ninja-build git pkg-config libgl1-mesa-dev libxkbcommon-dev libxcb*-dev libxkbcommon-x11-dev` (full list in `.github/workflows/build.yml`) |

CMake **3.25** or newer. Ninja recommended (Visual Studio generator works on
Windows but is slower).

## Multi-machine workflow

This project is set up to move cleanly between machines:

- vcpkg is cloned into `external/vcpkg/` and pinned to a baseline. Both are
  managed by `tools/bootstrap.*` and never committed.
- CMake presets reference the bundled vcpkg, so no environment variables are
  needed.
- A pull → configure → build cycle on a new machine is the same three commands
  as above.

### Build cache (recommended)

Install **sccache** so re-builds across machines / sessions are fast:

```
# macOS
brew install sccache
# Windows
scoop install sccache         # or  winget install sccache
# Ubuntu
sudo apt install sccache
```

`CMakePresets.json` already wires `CMAKE_C{,XX}_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=sccache`, so
once it is on `PATH` it is used automatically. To share the cache across
machines, set `SCCACHE_BUCKET=<your-s3-bucket>` (and credentials) before
running configure — sccache will pull pre-built objects on the second
machine.

## A note on paths with spaces

If your local clone path contains spaces (e.g. inherited from a workspace
folder named `16 Sensor`), CMake and vcpkg can occasionally misbehave. The
safe move is to clone this repo into a path **without spaces**, e.g.
`C:\dev\sensor3d` or `~/code/sensor3d`. The scaffold itself is portable —
just `git clone` to the new path on the new machine.

## License

TBD — add `LICENSE` in the repo root before publishing.
